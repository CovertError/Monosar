# Monosar
Monosar lThe main idea of the following project is creating a program that applies an encryption algorithm with its responding decryption algorithm in order to convert the plain text to cipher text. The Encryption algorithm focus mostly on the integration of variety encryption algorithm substitution cipher types in order to ensure adaption of secure cryptography, The basic architecture is divided to two rounds, the first being the monoalphabetic substitution and the second caesurae cipher substitution. Moving swiftly on to the decryption part which is implementing the decryption algorithm which has been derived from the encryption algorithm, starting with decrypting monoalphabetic substitution and moving on to decrypting  caesurae cipher substitution. As well as providing a user-friendly Graphical user interface for a more convenient experience for the users and a frequency analysis to represent more detailed information regarding the algorithms
